# Welcome to my blog

I’m glad you are here. I plan to talk about the need for a master id card for a person with disabilities. It is hard enough to live with a disability, such as Type 1 diabetes. Life is harder when you need to make special arrangements for things such as testing. My daughter has had to have paperwork filled out and/or approved by her doctor for the following situations: Being able to take Skittles in the testing lab in case she goes low. Having a bottle of water while working as a cashier. Needing an air conditioner in her dorm room.

If laws could be made that a person with a disability could have an ID card that must be accepted by everyone as proof of their disability, much of this hassle could be eliminated for all parties. The card could contain certain provisions such as needing candy or a bottle of water. Or these provisions could be recorded somewhere else. Doctors and nurses would have less paperwork, employers would have less red tape, and the person with the disability could live life much more easily.

I realize that it takes time and effort to accomodate disabilities. This idea could save all involved time, hassle, and red tape. As one example, my daughter was required to take a test at a testing center. She only had 5 days notice for the test. However, the testing center said they would need 10 days to approve her accomodation (bringing a bag of Skittles inside the testing area) after the receipt of her paperwork.

These cards would not be required, of course, but would be available for those who wished to have them. I am thinking of something similar to a driver’s license.
